# Bitcoin Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) Calculator

This project is a simple calculator that takes historical Bitcoin (BTC) data from the last 4 years and calculates how much BTC you would have accumulated if you dollar cost averaged (DCA) $50 per week during this period.

## What is Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)?

Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where you consistently invest a fixed amount of money into an asset over a set period, regardless of its price. In the context of Bitcoin, DCA means purchasing a certain dollar amount of BTC every week or month, helping to spread out your investment and potentially reduce the impact of market volatility.

### Why DCA?

DCA is particularly useful in highly volatile markets like cryptocurrency. It mitigates the risk of making a large investment at an unfavorable time by spreading purchases over a long period. DCA allows investors to average the cost of their Bitcoin holdings, buying more when prices are low and less when prices are high. This is a disciplined approach that helps reduce emotional trading and focuses on long-term gains.

## What Does This Calculator Do?

This calculator takes historical BTC data from the last 4 years and calculates how much BTC you would have if you invested $50 each week (approximately $200 a month) using the DCA strategy. By simulating this over a 4-year period, you can get a clear picture of how DCA would have worked during that time frame.

### Key Features:
- **Historical data analysis**: Pulls real BTC price data from the past 4 years.
- **Automated DCA calculation**: Computes how much BTC you would have accumulated by consistently investing $50 per week.
- **Long-term strategy evaluation**: Offers insight into the benefits of DCA over an extended period in a volatile market.

## Why Is This Calculation Important?

- **Reduce risk**: By buying in regularly, investors avoid trying to time the market, which can often lead to emotional decisions.
- **Market volatility**: BTC has seen massive price fluctuations. DCA takes advantage of this volatility by smoothing out the purchase price over time.
- **Long-term investing**: For those looking to hold Bitcoin for the long term, DCA can be an effective way to build up a sizable BTC holding without the stress of price swings.
